## 1.1 Proto Personas

### Persona 1

 **James Williams, A University Student**

James, age 19, is a First Year Psychology University Student at the University of Brighton.  He was born in Kent, where his mother is a GP and his father is a PE teacher at a secondary school. Despite living less than an hour from the University, he stays on campus with his friends to completely immerse himself in university life and become more independent. James also has a younger sister who is in college training to be a musical theatre performer, but they love spending time with each other and watching their favourite movie musicals when he is home. He is currently unemployed as he is focusing on his studies, but used to be an English tutor for GCSE students while studying for his A Levels.

James is passionate about film, and is an active member of the Film Society, frequently hosting movie nights for his friends as he is known for his great recommendations. He is particularly interested in the people behind the scenes, and can name the cast and crew of most films off the top of his head. James grew up watching classics with his dad and now enjoys discovering new releases and hidden gems with his peers. He enjoys a wide range of films and likes to follow specific actors and directors, his favourite being Steven Spielberg. He regularly researches film casts and behind-the-scenes trivia. He often uses his phone to browse ratings, read reviews and explore cast lists to learn more about his favourite films, and to choose films to add to a watchlist that would appeal to his friend group. He also takes pride in introducing them to lesser-known films and small directors that they may not have heard of. James' ideal app would allow him to efficiently search for movies based on their cast, track the work of his favourite actors and directors, and find something to suit everyone's tastes. He likes the idea of having ratings and film details in one place, and discovering up-and-coming filmmakers. He values quick access to up-to-date information, and hopes FlickFinder will not only save him time but also deepen his enjoyment of cinema by helping him explore and share a wider range of films he can enjoy with the people around him. He would be able to use the app to find new films to enjoy with his peers, and learn more about how his parents grew up by enjoying hits from their childhood. For James, FlickFinder would fuel his curiosity and help him share his passion for film with his friends and family.

### Persona 2

**Daisy King, A Small Business Owner**

Daisy is a 42-year-old business owner from Manchester who runs a successful online craft store while raising her two children (aged 5 and 9) with her husband, a chef. She has a degree in Business Management from the University of Sheffield, and started her own company at 25, hand-making a range of products from jewellery to personalised cards. Her husband has very long hours, so working from home leaves her balancing most household and parenting responsibilities with running her business, as she is the primary caregiver for their children. Her store has grown steadily over the years, but with handling everything from marketing and customer service to crafting the products herself, it's hard to keep up with family life while keeping her items at a high quality and satisfying her customers. She is always looking for ways to streamline her tasks, at home and at work, to prioritise time with her family.

In the little free time she has, she enjoys watching romantic comedies with her husband, and attending a book club with friends. Many of her favourite books are currently being adapted into films and she is looking forward to watching them with her friends. She often struggles to find time to relax, so reading provides her a moment for herself. When working from home while the kids are around, she often puts on a film to keep them entertained but finds it difficult to find content that is both appropriate and engaging without browsing endlessly or researching reviews. Daisy would value an app that helps her quickly find suitable films for her children, as well as something fun to watch with her husband. She would also like to stay updated on new releases and keep track of upcoming adaptations of her favourite books. She is well-accustomed to using apps to run her business, so FlickFinder would fit into her routine as another organisation tool. For Daisy, FlickFinder is a practical solution to reduce stress and free up time for the things that matter most.

## 1.2 Scenario

**James' Movie Marathon**

James is hosting a movie marathon for his best friend, Olivia, to celebrate her 20th birthday. He has decorated his student accommodation and bought snacks, but must now choose the line-up of the night. He is having 11 friends over, several from the university film society, and must accommodate for their range of taste in films and make sure that every choice is a crowd-pleaser.

He has worked out there will be time for 5 films, so James opens the FlickFinder app on his phone to start looking. He creates a watchlist titled 'Olivia's Movie Marathon' to keep track of his selection, then navigates to the search bar. Olivia's favourite actor is Andrew Garfield, so he searches this name, and applies filters to sort results by  highest-rated film. He selects the first 5 results, and adds them to his watchlist for reference, but quickly notices that two of the films are part of The Amazing Spider-Man series. In order to maintain a wide range of films for the night and avoid redundancy, he removes one from the list. James then conducts a second search, this time filtering by director, and selects a lesser-known title with high ratings from a director he had not heard of, and adds it to his watchlist.

James then reviews his choices, and sees that one of the films has an ensemble cast with actors that he knows several of his friends love, which will make the night even better. He then spends a bit of time looking over the cast of each movie so that he can answer any questions his friends have, and makes some information cards for his friends to read and keep as mementos, including the film name, director, cast, release year, average rating and some fun facts.

The final selection spans multiple genres, including a musical, drama, and an action-comedy, each from a different director. By using FlickFinder, James is able to plan the entire movie marathon in under 30 minutes. This would have usually taken over an hour to cross-reference difference websites (IMDB (IMDb: Ratings, Reviews, and Where to Watch the Best Movies & TV Shows, no date), Rotten Tomatoes (Rotten Tomatoes: Movies | TV Shows | Movie Trailers | Reviews | Rotten Tomatoes), film forums...). The movie marathon is a huge success and the guests are very pleased with the lineup. Olivia was very pleased to see her favourite actor featuring in all of the films, and everyone is impressed with the care James put into the experience. FlickFinder did not just help him pick movies, but allowed him to create a memorable experience. James has now been asked to plan another one!
